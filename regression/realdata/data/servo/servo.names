4. Relevant Information:

   Ross Quinlan:

   This data was given to me by Karl Ulrich at MIT in 1986.  I didn't 
   record his description at the time, but here's his subsequent (1992) 
   recollection:
 
     "I seem to remember that the data was from a simulation of a servo
     system involving a servo amplifier, a motor, a lead screw/nut, and a
     sliding carriage of some sort.  It may have been on of the
     translational axes of a robot on the 9th floor of the AI lab.  In any
     case, the output value is almost certainly a rise time, or the time
     required for the system to respond to a step change in a position set
     point."
 
   (Quinlan, ML'93)

   "This is an interesting collection of data provided by Karl 
    Ulrich.  It covers an extremely non-linear phenomenon - predicting the 
    rise time of a servomechanism in terms of two (continuous) gain settings
    and two (discrete) choices of mechanical linkages."
